# Surplus_smart
Project Overview

SurplusSmart is an AI-driven web platform designed to reduce food wastage and redistribute surplus food from restaurants and donors to nearby receivers in need.
It integrates Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and APIs to assess food nutrients, evaluate suitability for different age groups, and facilitate redistribution through a seamless donor–receiver network.

🌍 Inspired by platforms like NoFoodWaste.org
, SurplusSmart aims to create a sustainable food ecosystem that connects donors, NGOs, and individuals to minimize wastage and fight hunger.
